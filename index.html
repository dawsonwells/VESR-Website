            <h2>My Top 4 Personal Values</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>1. Intregrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching.</p>
            <p>2. I learned this value from my school teachers and from my parents instilling it in me at a young age.</p>
            <p>3. It's important because people who have integrity know who they are and are not swayed by other people. 
                They stay true to themselves regardless of what others think. It's an honorable way to live.</p>
            <p>4. People won't be able to trust you if you don't have integrity. You'll be alone because people won't want to be around a liar.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Discipline</h3>
            <p>1. Discipline is doing what you need to do, even when you don't feel like doing it.</p>
            <p>2. I mainly learned this value from my parents and how they always worked hard and suffered quietly, which I now see looking back at my childhood.</p>
            <p>3. It's important because without discipline, nothing gets done. You need discipline in order to achieve your goals.</p>
            <p>4. A person who lacks discipline will have trouble achieving his/her goals and let life happen to them.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Humility</h3>
            <p>1. Humility is thinking of yourself less, and putting the needs of others above your own.</p>
            <p>2. I developed this value naturally because I was always a shy person who let others take the spotlight. I also learned true humility from Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>3. It's important because it takes my focus away from myself and towards other people by thinking of myself less and lifting others up.</p>
            <p>4. If you're always focusing on your own problems, you'll always be internally distracted and miss what's right in front of you.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Respect</h3>
            <p>1. Respect means to treat others the way you want to be treated.</p>
            <p>2. My parents fostered an atmosphere of respect by treating each other respectfully. They'd also discipline me when I got into fights with my siblings.</p>
            <p>3. It's important to acknowledge that every human has innate value, therefore, respecting each other creates a common understanding.</p>
            <p>4. Respect produces respect. If you don't give people respect, they probably won't respect you.</p>
