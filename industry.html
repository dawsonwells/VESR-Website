            <h3>Cybersecurity Issues + Best Practices</h3>
            <p>Issue #1 - Intellectual Property Theft: People inside and outside the company can steal digital assets for themselves, either to make money or to undermine company processes.</p>
            <p>Best Practice: Make sure the team's work is protected by copright, so that you can legally claim ownership for all original work.</p>
            <p>Issue #2 - Malware/Phishing: Malware can spread through phishing emails sent to employees. These emails try to get people to click on hyperlinks that download viruses or give access to the wrong party.</p>
            <p>Best Practice: Always check the email sender. If it seems suspicious, report it and don't click on any links. Also, team members can use encrypted emails so that only people with the key can access them.</p>
